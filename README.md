# Pincer x402 Reference Implementation

This repository contains a production-quality reference implementation
of Pincer’s x402-sponsored access flow.

It demonstrates how x402 paywalled content, sponsored offers,
merchant webhooks, and post-pay rebates can work together end-to-end.

While this codebase is actively evolving, it is designed to be
clean, extensible, and suitable as a foundation for real integrations.
